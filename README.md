# Decentralized online voting system using Etherum Virtual Machine with Smart contract

## Concept
I created a **decentralized voting website** which allows the owner to create a vote. \
He adds the candidates one by one and creates a **whitelist for addresses** that are allowed to vote. *(scripts/whitelist.json)* \
The whitelist works as a **merkle tree.**\
The voting is managed by a **smart contract.** *(contracts/Vote.sol)*

## Features
Features of the website are **dependent on the address connected.**
 - Owner has possibilities to add candidates and see results.
 - Voters has possibility to vote.
 - Others sees nothing.
